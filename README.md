## Description
Based on the classic Space Invaders arcade videogame, this app was designed with some extra interesting calculation rules:
1. Ships have different lives depending upon their color (2 x red and yellow, 1 x blue and green)
2. If the player shots an enemy ship, then that ship gets destroyed as well as all the adjacent ships of the same color.
3. Colors for the enemy ships are arbitrarily selected.
4. The player's initial state on the game is with three lives.
5. When the screen shows the game-over mode, the app leads the user to the main menu.
